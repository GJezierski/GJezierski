### Hi 👋, I'm Grzegorz Jezierski

🌐 Master of Science in Telecommunications Engineering | Postgraduate Studies in Project Management | 8 Years as Chief Specialist, Monitoring & Network Operations Center | CERT/SOC Specialist T1 - 1 Year | Python Enthusiast | Cybersecurity Advocate 🛡️

As a Telecommunications Engineer with a strong foundation in network operations and monitoring, I thrive in the dynamic realm of technology and connectivity. Over the years, I've honed my skills as a Chief Specialist in the Monitoring and Network Operations Center Department, ensuring the seamless functionality and performance of critical network infrastructures.

Recently, I expanded my skill set by completing the comprehensive Python From Scratch course at Software Development Academy. Equipped with a solid foundation in Python programming, I leverage this knowledge to create innovative automation solutions, streamline network operations, and enhance efficiencies in telecommunications systems.

My enthusiasm for cybersecurity fuels my continuous learning journey. As a SOC/CERT Tier 1 professional, I am adept at handling security incidents, providing swift responses, and ensuring the integrity of networks. Additionally, my passion extends to actively engaging in platforms like TryHackMe, where I refine my skills, solve challenges, and stay abreast of the latest cybersecurity trends and techniques.

Web application in Django, which, by connecting to the OpenWeather API, allows you to check the current weather conditions in selected cities. A registered user can view more than one city and save it to favorites. The system notifies the user of unsafe conditions. The application was built with two contributors.
